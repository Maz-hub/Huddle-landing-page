# Frontend Mentor – Huddle Landing Page (Single Section)

This project is a solution to the [Huddle Landing Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0) on Frontend Mentor. It focuses on creating a clean hero section with responsive layout and modern CSS.

## 📋 Project Overview

The goal was to build a responsive landing page section with background images, centered content, and call-to-action button. I used vanilla HTML and CSS to handle layout and styling across screen sizes.

## 💡 What I Practiced

- Switching **background images** between mobile and desktop
- Preventing unwanted horizontal **overflow**
- Responsive sizing without relying heavily on media queries
- Using the modern and flexible **`clamp()`** function

> I enjoyed exploring how to optimize for various screen sizes more fluidly. Suggestions or corrections are always welcome. 😊

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- `clamp()` for fluid typography and spacing
